NodeJS module for getting and parsing metadata from SHOUTcast/Icecast radio streams.

## Features

- Opens async connection to URL and gets response with radio stream and metadata. Then pipes response to Transform stream for processing;
- Getting metadata from stream is realized in Transform stream, so you can pipe radio station stream to another Writable\Duplex\Transform stream;
- Once metadata is received, `metadata` event triggers with metadata object;
- After metadata is received, connection to radio station closes automatically, so you will not spent a lot of traffic;
- But you can set `keepListen` flag in config object and continue listening radio station;
- Auto updating metadata from radio station by interval in economical way (connection is opens when time has come);
- Metadata parsed as object with key-value;
- When you create new instance, you get EventEmitter. So you can subscribe to other events;
- Easy to configure and use;

## Getting started

You can install icecast-parser from npm.
```shell
npm install icecast-parser
```

Get your first metadata from radio station.
```javascript
const Parser = require('icecast-parser');

const radioStation = new Parser('http://streaming.radionomy.com/JamendoLounge');

radioStation.on('metadata', function(metadata) {
    console.log([metadata.StreamTitle, 'is playing on', this.getConfig('url')].join(' '));
});
```

## Configuration

You can provide additional parameters to constructor:

- `url` - by default empty and **REQUIRED**.
- `keepListen` - by default `false`. If you set to `true`, then response from radio station is not destroys and you can pipe it to another streams.
- `autoUpdate` - by default `true`. If you set to `false`, then metadata will not be updates with interval and notify you about new metadata;
- `errorInterval` - by default `600` s. You can set interval in seconds when next try will be executed if connection was refused or rejected. Works only if `autoUpdate` is enabled.
- `emptyInterval` - by default `300` s. You can set interval in seconds when next try will be executed if metadata is empty. Works only if `autoUpdate` is enabled.
- `metadataInterval` - by default `5` s. You can set interval in seconds when will be next update of metadata. Works only if `autoUpdate` is enabled.

```javascript
const Parser = require('icecast-parser');

const radioStation = new Parser({
    url: 'http://streaming.radionomy.com/JamendoLounge', // URL to radio station
    keepListen: false, // don't listen radio station after metadata was received
    autoUpdate: true, // update metadata after interval
    errorInterval: 10 * 60, // retry connection after 10 minutes
    emptyInterval: 5 * 60, // retry get metadata after 5 minutes
    metadataInterval: 5 // update metadata after 5 seconds
});

radioStation.on('metadata', function(metadata) {
    console.log('Here you will receive metadata each 10 seconds');
    console.log(metadata.StreamTitle);
});
```

## Events

You can subscribe to 4 events - `error`, `empty`, `metadata`, `stream`.

- `error` event triggers when connection to radio station was refused, rejected or timed out;
- `empty` event triggers when connection was established successful, but radio station doesn't return metaint byte in response headers;
- `metadata` event triggers when connection was established successful and metadata is parsed successful;
- `stream` event triggers when response from radio station returned and successfully piped to Transform stream.

```javascript
const Parser = require('icecast-parser');

const radioStation = new Parser({
    url: 'http://streaming.radionomy.com/JamendoLounge'
    keepListen: true
});

radioStation.on('error', function(error) {
    console.log(['Connection to', this.getConfig('url'), 'was rejected'].join(' '));
});

radioStation.on('empty', function() {
    console.log(['Radio station', this.getConfig('url'), 'doesn\'t have metadata'].join(' '));
});

radioStation.on('metadata', function(metadata) {
    console.log(metadata.StreamTitle);
});

radioStation.on('stream', function(stream) {
    stream.pipe(process.stdout);
});
```

## How to get radio's stream for your purposes?

You can use `stream` event for that.
When connection is established, parser is sending stream as first argument to your listener.

**Note:** You **MUST** enable `keepListen` in configuration object.

```javascript
const Parser = require('icecast-parser');

const radioStation = new Parser({
    url: 'http://streaming.radionomy.com/JamendoLounge',
    keepListen: true // keep listening radio station
});

radioStation.on('stream', function(stream) {
    stream.pipe(process.stdout); // Stream it's readable stream and you can pipe it to any writable stream
});
```
